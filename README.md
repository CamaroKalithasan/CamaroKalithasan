ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m CamaroKalithasan

FullSail Alumni in Game Development Bachelors September 2022
Throughout my life I have always had a passion for gaming, whether it was mobile, PC, or console, and have wanted to pursue a career in video game development.
After attending Full Sail, I have made it my ultimate goal to put 1000% of my effort into the industry and bring up crazy new ideas or work with a team 
on an enjoyable game that can put a lasting impact on the market. I love programming and games and hope to share that with others!
